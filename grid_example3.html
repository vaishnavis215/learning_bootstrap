                                <p class="text-black">The bidding war began with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), his former team, aiming to reacquire him after his successful captaincy in the previous season. But PBKS quickly entered the race, and DC also joined the battle, pushing the price higher. The competition was fierce, with DC leading at 20 crore, but PBKS fought back, raising the bid to 26.75 crore, ultimately securing Iyer. His price shattered the previous record, making him the most expensive player ever in an IPL auction.</p>
